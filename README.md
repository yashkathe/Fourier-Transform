# Fourier Transform

The Fourier transform is a mathematical tool that breaks down a signal, like a
sound or an image, into its fundamental frequency components. It helps analyze
and represent complex signals in terms of simpler sinusoidal waves, revealing
the different frequencies present. This transformation is widely used in various
fields, such as signal processing, communications, and image analysis, to
understand and manipulate the frequency content of signals.
