## Complex Numbers

![3](../readme_content/2/3)

The idea of complex numbers is to extend the framework of number line from a 1-D
line to 2-D plane

![2](../readme_content/2/2)

-> Complex Numbers and the imaginary opearator are very useful for applications
in signal processing, engineering etc

The reason why complex numbers are so useful is that they pack a lot of
information into a very compact representation

- The Fourier transform returns complex numbers and you take the magnitude or
  the distance of the complex Fourier coefficient away from the origin and that
  is taken to be the amplitude at some frequency. And the angle with respect to
  the positive real axis is going to be the phase at that frequency.

### Calculate magnitude of Complex Numbers

#### Method 1: Creating a right angled triangle

![4](../readme_content/2/4)

#### Method 2: Take complex conjugate of complex number

![5](../readme_content/2/5)

Conjugate of complex number is the number with the sign og imaginary part
flipped
